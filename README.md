# TIC-TAC-TOE
The Odin Project -  JS path, tic tac toe path


Project goal is to use JS modules. To do so I tried to have as little global code as possible. I triedtucking everything away inside of a module or factory. Based on the following rule of thumb: if you only ever need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController), use a module. If you need multiples of something (players!), create them with factories.
